# Express Tutorial App

I went through Wes Bos' Node course and build the Express/MongoDb restaurant application. After running `npm install` or `yarn install` should just be able to run this locally using `npm start` or `yarn start`

Requires Node 8+ 

Below is the original README from Wes Bos:

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

| Name          | Email (login)      | Password |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| Wes Bos       | wes@example.com    | wes      |
| Debbie Downer | debbie@example.com | debbie   |
| Beau          | beau@example.com   | beau     |
